# ALX-SYSTEM_ENGINEERING-DEVOPS

This repository contains the codes written for the system and engineering devops project at ALX
Africa. This project was one of the many projects I worked on during the 1 year program, I 
learned about shell basics, shell permissions, shell I/O redirections and filters and shell 
init files, variables and expansions
