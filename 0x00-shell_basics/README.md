#Shell, basics

In this project, I learned what the shell was and used basics shell commands 
like pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, less, ln, rm, cp, and mv. I also practiced working
with the 'type', 'which' and 'help', 'man' and 'file' commands, I also learnt
how to implement wildcards, create html links, symbolic links, and magic file.
